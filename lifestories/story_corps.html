<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >       The food court at the mall was full of a variety of targets for the task at hand, collecting stories, but
all the stories I had captured so far hadn&#8217;t really stuck me as great stories. Sure, some of them were
interesting or even funny &#8212; one man told me a story about how some workers had asked him if he had
seen Waldo, and he told them &#8220;No&#8221;, even though he knew the stranger hiding behind the newspaper next
to him was Waldo &#8212; but these stories didn&#8217;t seem to have a whole lot to take away besides their
entertainment value. However, the next story I heard from the next target was an entirely different kind of
beast.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >       Up till this point, I had been attempting to keep my targets varied. Some were young and some
were older, some were white and some were not, and some had nose-rings and others did not. It was
almost a subconscious thought of the scientist inside me striving for an accurate sample of that mall
environment. So when I spotted two men, one being in a wheel chair, I decided that they would make the
perfect addition to my collection. As with the previous other groups, I approached cautiously so as to not
startle, and I proceeded to ask if they would like to share some stories related to their experiences at the
mall.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >       The one on the left was a clean-shaven, middle-aged man with shorter, dark hair; really an
average looking guy. His name, as I later learned, was Marcos. The one on the right sat in a
wheel chair with the slumped posture of a very bored teenager in history class. Although he
appeared younger than the former, he was also older than myself with defined lines under his eyes

and pork-chop-shaped sideburns. His mouth hung slightly ajar and his stained shirt didn&#8217;t
quite fall down to his waist revealing a strip of skin. His name was James, and he spoke up
first.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;I have a story to tell.&#8221;
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Okay, great! I&#8217;m ready when you are.&#8221;
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;I&#8217;m... I&#8217;m whats called a bounty hunter,&#8221; he said with difficulty, each word seemed almost
painful.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >       I nearly started laughing. Here was this guy in a wheelchair slurring his speech, and I was trying to
draw a comparison to Bubba Fett, the bounty hunter in Star Wars. How could this guy ever be successful
trying to catch anyone? He couldn&#8217;t possibly be serious, could he? But, I kept my mouth shut and
listened.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;You know like Dog? The TV show?&#8221;
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Sure,&#8221; I said even though I had no clue. Really I wanted to see where this would
go.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Right now, I&#8217;m working on my cases, though I don&#8217;t have any to show yet, but being in a wheel
chair is not the easiest thing in the world to do.&#8221;
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;It&#8217;s a little hard to be a bounty hunter,&#8221; I said, hinting that I thought it would be near
impossible.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;It&#8217;s hard but you gotta know what&#8217;s going on at all times, cause if you don&#8217;t and you walk into a
situation and you&#8217;re thinking everything&#8217;s fine, then BAM! And then you&#8217;re right in the middle of it.
You&#8217;re breaking up a fight, then you&#8217;re in the hospital.&#8221;
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >       Eager to hear more about one of his cases, I questioned, &#8220;Have you bounty hunted
recently?&#8221;
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;I&#8217;ve got several that I&#8217;m working on right now. I run though Lakewood, marshals, FBI, all that. So
for example, if you go to www.usmarshalls.com, you will see the 15 top most wanted. That&#8217;s what I check
around the clock.&#8221;
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >       At this point, I could see that he was no longer joking about being a bounty hunter and my

thoughts transitioned into being fearful for his safety. Was this guy even armed? Did he just wheel up to
one of these most wanted guys and ask them in the same forced, broken English I was listening to if they
could put on a pair of handcuffs?
<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >       James continued, &#8220;If they have a new case on that list, I go to work. If they have an old
case still on that list, I still go to work until I&#8217;m sure that he&#8217;s been caught or is dead. I&#8217;ve
been up for hours... days. I&#8217;ve been up for what &#8212; Marcos? &#8212; 3, 4, 5 thousand hours at a
time.&#8221;
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >       James ended with this, &#8220;My best advice is, if you surprise them, they can&#8217;t run.&#8221;
<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >       With that, I figured I had enough story about bounty hunting and the awkwardness in imagining
James filling the role, so started to thank them for their time so as to leave. Yet Marcos spoke up, &#8220;I have a
story,&#8221; and I was trapped reluctantly.
<!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Last month, my little sister got married. Out of my mom&#8217;s kids, there&#8217;s three of us: my sister Nina
and my little sister Barbette. So my little sister got married, invited me to the wedding, and I went with
her. I had a good time, but after the ceremony, when everything was over, she wanted to go out
bar-hopping. So then I told her that I brought money, so I could spend time with her, and so she could have
the best day ever. But she crushed her brother&#8217;s heart and stepped on it like it was nothing more than a
piece of candy.&#8221;
<!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;How so?&#8221; I said cautiously curious.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Well, she decided to go out bar-hopping with all the groomsmen and bridesmaids. I was one of
the groomsmen, but she kicked me to the curb. She left me in the hotel with her husband&#8217;s father, all
because of the fact I&#8217;m special. It tore my heart to shreds.&#8221;
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >       Marcos continued.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Afterwards I saw a picture of her on Facebook with her arm broken.&#8221;
<!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;From what?&#8221; I said trying hard to follow along.
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Well, I have a pretty good hunch that it was her husband, because he was in that picture, and who
know what they say about pictures?&#8221;
<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;What?&#8221;

<!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;When it comes to stuff like that: whoever is in the picture; they&#8217;re making it too obvious.&#8221;
<!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;So you think he is responsible?&#8221;
<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Yeah, because she looks hurt in the picture, but he is all happy. And that is suspicious.&#8221;
<!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Have you tried talking to her about it?&#8221;
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Not at this time, because I don&#8217;t want her to think that I want to break up her marriage. Cause I&#8217;m
the only kid out of my mom&#8217;s three kids that hasn&#8217;t gotten married yet, and according to my little sister
there is something wrong with that. She says if I stay single and stay like this forever, then I&#8217;m never
going to find happiness. But I don&#8217;t think that is true.&#8221;
<!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >       We continued to talk for a bit longer and I heard one more story about the place he worked at, and
then I finally thanked them for their stories. Marcus ended with the following, &#8220;When you turn your
stories in and they ask what kind of people you talked to, tell them you talked to two mentally disabled
people, just so they know where were coming from.&#8221;
<!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >       Then I left, but I started thinking about those two stories. A thought crept into my head. I had
doubted James&#8217; ability, his vision, of becoming a bounty hunter almost the same way Marcos&#8217; sister had
doubted his ability to achieve happiness by not getting married. Which led me thinking to my own visions.
Here I was graduating in about a month, but what if the people I had told I was aspiring to become a
Computer Scientist laughed at me? What if they told me I would never find a job? It would have
immensely discouraged me without the support and belief of those around me. I probably would not have
made it. With this train of thought, I regretted thinking what I had thought of James the bounty
hunter, and wished both Marcos and James the best of luck in pursuing their visions. For
although they may not line up with my definitions of good goals, who was I to judge?
