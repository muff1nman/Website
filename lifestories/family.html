<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >       Have you ever been in one of those situations when your family or friends want to go on a trip that
you don&#8217;t want to go on? Maybe it&#8217;s as simple as a trip to the grocery store, or maybe it&#8217;s a
long trek across the country to visit relatives. In either case, we trudge along unwillingly,
but something happens during that trip that we didn&#8217;t expect and later we realize that it was
good we went along after all. For me, I did not want to go with my family on a trip to North
Dakota.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >       I was about 13 and lived in Colorado with two younger brothers and two hard-working parents. We
were definitely not rich by any stretch of the word, but our parents worked endlessly to satisfy our needs
and wants as young boys. In return, us boys, well... we ate all the food and enjoyed childhood.
My brothers and I fell into a sort of routine. Dad would wake us up and drive us to the bus
stop. We hopped on the school bus, and once at school, were entertained throughout the day
by our teachers. Then, we would come home and play. One of the &#8220;cool&#8221; things back then
was the handheld Gameboy. My brothers and I each had one and would play Pokemon, a
game allowing us to brag about the strongest monsters we had trained and all the cool items
we had gathered throughout the virtual world. If we were feeling adventurous, we would go

over to the neighbors&#8217; house to play baseball or football. Meanwhile, Mother would prepare
meals and invite us to dinner once it was ready. It was quickly devoured by gaping mouths and
then we would run off back to whatever we were enjoying. Needless to say, we gave little
thought into what actually went into creating a meal for a family that included three growing
boys.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >       Sometime in the late fall, our parents suggested that we would take a road trip up to desolate North
Dakota to visit relatives. Although we had been there before, this was really the first time I actually
remember going up there, and of course, my first question was if there was anything fun to do. My
mother&#8217;s response wasn&#8217;t too convincing: &#8220;Well, we are going there to butcher with Grandma and the
relatives.&#8221; My brothers and I didn&#8217;t know what &#8220;butchering&#8221; was but it didn&#8217;t sound fun. We
fought back but to no avail, and a couple days later we were traveling over a thousand miles to
Langdon, North Dakota, a small town about 10 miles from the US-Canada border in the middle of
nowhere.
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >       For the reader unaccustomed with North Dakota, I must provide some geographical background.
You see, North Dakota is <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-120">flat</span>. Oh you might say, yeah, well Kansas or Nebraska or any of those other
mid-western states is flatter. And I&#8217;m here to say you&#8217;re wrong, mostly because I&#8217;ve been though them all.
Kansas to North Dakota is like a camel&#8217;s back to a thrice tire-smashed gofer. And I haven&#8217;t
even begun to compare North Dakota to Colorado. To add to the misery, the landscape is
an unpleasant spattering of brown and gray with barren trees scattered every so often. An
occasional farm rivets the horizon every 10 miles or so. The scenery, or lack thereof, is almost
depressing.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >       Fortunately my brothers and I brought along not only our Gameboys, but also the
Nintendo 64. The new family van had a drop down screen, which although small, sufficed for
Smashbros and some movies. It was far better than staring at the wearisome landscape that slid
past.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >       We arrived two days later, pulling up a dirt driveway and parking beside two other cars. The van
looked out of place with its new, sparkling, navy-blue paint, angled hood and sharp headlights parked next

to a boxy, dull-white Oldsmobile and an old, weathered Ford pickup with bulbous lights. Looking around,
there were several gray barns with old, rusting farm equipment strewn about. The silo rose just
beyond; it was all white except for a checkered band closer to the top, hugging the rounded
side like an old, faded quilt. The single story house had peeling, baby-blue siding with white
windows, panes faded from years of exposure. We stepped inside, forced almost by the raw, cold
wind.
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >       Immediately my heart sank as I stepped inside and saw the sea of people: aunts, uncles, cousins,
nephews, grandparents and all with big smiling faces seemingly ready to pounce at a moment&#8217;s notice
with an attack of hugs. Being shy, I immediately began dreading the trip and wanted to escape to
the nearest corner where no one could find me. Seeing no escape, I waited for my turn of
hellos and embraces. Then I got to Grandma. I had met her before, but this was really the
first time I remember her. She was short, with dark hair, and she wore a wool sweater, blue
pants and black shoes. She had high cheekbones, with lined skin draped over them and had
thick-rimmed glasses framing a pair of brown eyes. Those same eyes gleamed from under
the glasses and a wide smile beamed back at me. She offered me a hug and I hesitatingly
accepted.
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >       We arrived late, and soon everyone was off to bed. Our bedroom was upstairs and I walked
down the creaking hallway. It was dimly lit by a single, stained-glass lamp, and I trudged
up the uneven staircase, holding onto the wobbly, wrought iron handrail. After fetching my
toothbrush, I walked into the bathroom. The sink was clean but stained, the mirror scratched and
scuffed, and the faucet was a dull metallic with large mineral deposits forming in the grooves. I
scrubbed, spit and cupped some water into my mouth and immediately spit it back out. The water
tasted of a musky, salted stench and overpowered the mint from the toothpaste. I gave up
rinsing and found a place marked by blankets where I laid to sleep. I watched my youngest
brother come out of the bathroom with a disgusted look and he moaned, &#8220;Mom, the water
tastes terrible.&#8221; She agreed the water had a funny sulfur taste but said it was safe to drink
and we were only going to be there a little while. I sat there uncomfortably for a long time

wondering how Grandma put up with the house she was living in. It was nothing like our
house back home, where at least we had good tasting well water. But I was puzzled. Grandma
had always sent me and every single one of her 54 grandchildren one hundred bucks every
Christmas. She sent my parents even more money. Why didn&#8217;t she use some of that to fix up her
house?
<!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >       I was wakened early by the sun filtering in. I roughed my sleeping brothers a bit but received
hateful looks in response. I wandered downstairs and found Grandma preparing breakfast and a couple of
my cousins sitting at the table eating. There was a wealth of options: cereals, bread and jam,
oatmeal, fruits and much more. Grandma brought over a plate of golden, stacked toast. &#8220;Would
you like some toast Andrew?&#8221; I took some but noticed Grandma was eating a piece of black,
burnt bread. I questioned why she didn&#8217;t throw it away. &#8220;Oh, I like my toast a little crispy&#8221; she
replied with that same big smile I had seen last night. &#8220;Are you going to help butcher?&#8221; she
asked.
<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Um, I dunno&#8221; I replied sheepishly, not wanting to agree to something too arduous. After
finishing breakfast, I slipped away upstairs to find my brothers playing Gameboy. I quickly joined
them.
<!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >       My mother found us hiding upstairs, and to our dismay sent us to the barn to help with the work.
Reluctantly we stepped into the cold fresh air outside and arrived at a side room to one of the
barns. We stepped inside. It was a smallish room, the walls all white-washed. There were many
stainless steel counters around the border of the room, and a wood-burning stove off to the side
barely fending off the cold. On the opposite side was a large band saw with half of a cow laid
down on the bench. It was fed into whirring blades, specks of pink matter sprung from the
contact point as two of my uncles, Phil and Galen, carved chunks from the body. Around the
counters, were many more people each with hunks of bleeding meat and long knives, trimming
lard<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="family.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2f1"></a>
and dividing the meat into smaller pieces for the grinders and meat packers. I saw Grandma at one counter

working while talking with another relative, still smiling of course. My Aunt, Bonnie found me standing,
and asked, &#8220;Would you like to help make sausage, Andrew?&#8221;. I had no idea how to make sausage, but I
agreed, feeling like it would be impolite to say no. She walked me over to what I called the sausage
machine<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="family.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3f2"></a>, a
towering, cast-iron cylinder with a faucet-like opening near the bottom. Near the top it had a worn wooden
crank that one of my cousins was laboriously turning. It gave ever so slowly. Another younger cousin
carried over a 5 gallon bucket full of ground pork. She pulled out gobs of the spaghetti-like meat
and stood on her tippy toes to dump it into the top of the sausage machine. I was assigned
the receiving end and held the squirmy pig intestine casings to the opening while each filled
with meat. Although I usually didn&#8217;t get queasy easily, it was a bit perturbing knowing what
actually encased sausages. Yet another cousin carefully rolled the sausages into circles, cut them
and carried the finished product to the freezer packagers. It was difficult work and when I
thought I was tired enough, the cousin cranking traded spots with me. Soon, I was absolutely
fatigued.
<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >       For three more days, we were at the farm. I learned more about butchering and the farm. The room
we worked in used to be a milking parlor from when the farm was a bustling dairy farm in the years
when my Mom and her nine siblings were children. It had been converted to a butchering
room. The bulk tank room where thousands of gallons of milk was once stored was now a
walk-in cooling room. The beef cows we were butchering had been raised from calves by
some of our relatives, who fattened them up on their own herding lands and other relatives
raised pigs. These cows and pigs would become a primary source of food for not only my
family and my large extended family, but also for many in the town of Langdon. In that way,
Grandma&#8217;s converted butchering facility provided for the community as a primary source of cheap
meat.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >       I got the chance to take on some of the more difficult tasks of the butchering process, which I
started to enjoy. I was able to try trimming the lard from the meat which proved difficult as many of the

knives dulled quickly. One of the fun tasks was to spice the sausage. Many buckets of meat were piled into
an enormous bowl that was practically large enough to swim in. I was amazed as Uncle Phil put in
heaps of spices, not even measuring them, as if it was second nature like walking was to me.
Then he had some cousins and I take off our shoes and socks and after washing our feet, we
stepped into the bowl of meat. We mashed it with our feet and it felt was if we were standing in
pool of pink worms as they squirmed beneath our feet and between our toes. We stamped
and squashed, mixed and mingled the spice into the meat as if we were kids in a puddle of
mud.
<!--l. 234--><p class="indent" >       Despite all the work, I continued to watch Grandma over those long days. She perplexed me. Here
was this old woman who though shorter than I, was doing four times as much work as I. She cooked, she
cleaned, and she brought in firewood for the furnace, and really took care of the entire family all with a
smile on her face. I thought that it was supposed to be the other way around. Weren&#8217;t we supposed to be
looking after her? Instead, she was orchestrating the butchering process and in turn providing sustenance
for her family of 64 daughters, sons, their children and their children&#8217;s children and not to mention many
other families in Langdon.
<!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >       At the end of the trip, I began to feel a sense of awe and wonder for my Grandma. She showed me
what self-sacrifice was and the value of hard work. The trip to North Dakota also opened my eyes to the
many amenities I take for granted: buying prepackaged meat from the store, electric heaters
or even clear tasting water. However, one thing is for certain. Nothing tastes better than a
fresh sausage patty roasted on the open, wood fire of a butcher&#8217;s stove after a hard day of
work.
