<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >Dear Reader,
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >       This portfolio of five stories written over the course of a semester has been a journey of
several purposes. Of course in one part, &#8220;Life Stories&#8221; has been my first and last LAIS 400
course, but it is also the one of the last classes of my college curriculum &#8212; possibly one of the
most difficult.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >       This brings me to the second aspect of the journey; this class has challenged me to
rediscover writing. Whereas previously writing only served as a tool for communicating and
conveying technical ideas, I have found that writing can also be used for sharing stories. In
addition, my perception on stories has changed drastically. Where once before I thought of stories
only for their entertainment value, now after reading stories, listening to stories and being mindful
of the stories around me, I can see that they are so much more. They define how we act and think
about the world around us. They influence us, change us and mold us in ways I never thought
possible before.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >       With that, I would like to share this compilation of stories. Although the stories were
initially created as individual entities, each with their own ideas, I have found that many of the
stories hold the same core to them: my ideals. Of course it makes sense as I wrote them all, but it
had never occurred prior to compiling these stories that I had injected my opinions so firmly at the
heart of my writing. With an even further look, there is a hidden, but nevertheless present, theme
throughout these stories that almost boils down to: What is it that brings one happiness? It is a
truly interesting question, one that we all at one time or another are sure to face ourselves. But
what is even more interesting, is that it doesn&#8217;t really have a concrete answer. Is it hard-work? Is it
self-sacrifice? Is it religion? Is it our outlook on life? Is it perhaps love? Something else? Or
perhaps a combination? Or is it just a fruitless search for the nonexistent? Almost inadvertently, I

have explored some of these thoughts in the following stories. I&#8217;m not out to persuade anyone that
I have found the key to happiness, because I most certainly haven&#8217;t, nor was/is that even my
intended goal, but rather these stories serve as a self-discovery of my own questionings. Maybe
you&#8217;ll find them thoughtful, maybe you won&#8217;t, but hopefully you&#8217;ll consider them and ask
yourself, &#8220;What is it that makes one happy?&#8221;
