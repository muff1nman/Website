			 <!-- begin written content -->
<div class="flushleft" >
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >       Jesus. Sure we have heard about him one way or another. Maybe you are a Christian and have been
taught about him before, or maybe you aren&#8217;t and have heard his stories in pieces. But in either case, how
would you describe who Jesus is? Maybe you might think of bible stories or maybe you just think of him
as a cloaked Jedi who has lost his light saber. I know I have a hard time describing who he is and much
less relating to him, but some years back I had heard a story. Although not the end all, be all story about
this important Christian totem, I have found it has been one piece in figuring out what Jesus is all
about.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >       There was a college professor teaching a class about religion. He was a pleasant, short man with
graying hair and round-rimmed glasses that always seemed to slip down his nose. He had just started
the Christianity chapter with his class, however he perplexed on how to best teach the next
topic. He thought and pondered well into the night. A couple hours slipped by as it became
darker, but finally he came up with an idea. &#8220;I know what to do!&#8221; the professor thought and he
slept.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >       The next day before class, he waited outside the classroom. He recited his students
names, still of course, trying to learn them. Here came Sean, Peter, Garry. Then came Kathy,
Emily and Bobby. And then he saw Daniel round the red, brick-walled corner. Daniel stood

at least a head taller than the others walking past him and towered over the professor. He
had a thick trunk of a neck protruding from a muscular, rippling core. His backpack seemed
three sizes too small as the straps choked into his well-defined chest. His giant arms swung at
his side, with his forearms slightly bent, a more natural position for the massive network of
muscles that seemed ready to burst at a moments notice. Daniel was one of the school&#8217;s best
football players and he was perfect for the purpose the professor had in mind. He flagged him
down.
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Daniel, do you suppose you could help me with class today?&#8221;
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Um... sure? What for?&#8221;
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Well, I need someone that can do about 200 push-ups. Do you think you could do that?&#8221; the
professor asked hopefully.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >       Daniel was taken aback. He had never been asked to exercise in the classroom before, but he
wasn&#8217;t about to turn down a challenge.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;That&#8217;s more than I&#8217;ve ever done before, but if I took my time, I might be able to.&#8221;
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >       The professor thanked him for being willing to help out and they both stepped into the classroom.
Most everyone was seated already in the rows of desks, anxiously waiting for class to begin so it could
finish. The professor quickly counted them, noting the number 21. The professor walked behind his desk
at the front of the classroom and busied himself. Daniel stood off to the side, awkwardly shifting his
weight, not sure what he was supposed to do. The professor then straightened up and turned around
walking back to the front of the room. He carried three big pails of Bluebell ice cream &#8212; vanilla,
chocolate, and strawberry. The student&#8217;s eyes widened greedily. This was not how any previous
lecture had started before. The professor set out a stack of cheap, plastic bowls and a carton of
spoons.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Now, I brought a treat along today, and everyone is going to have some. But... there is one small
catch.&#8221;
<!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >       Various students rolled their eyes. Of course there was a catch. There always was.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;For each bowl of ice cream I hand out, Daniel here will do 10 push-ups.&#8221;

<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >       The room was silent. Each of the students looked at Daniel as they mulled over the proposal in
their mind.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;10 push-ups is nothing for Dan!&#8221; Bobby remarked, leaping out of his chair and striding to the ice
cream.
<!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >       Daniel grinned a wide smile back at him. The professor motioned for him to start and Daniel
dropped to the floor quickly letting his brawny arms catch him before his upper body met the floor. He
rapidly elevated and lowered himself 10 times. Each push-up was perfect with his body straight as a plank
and his face snapped at the floor barely grazing the tip of his nose just as a hawk dives to snatch a fish out
of water and soars away. He jumped up as his feet bounded up to his hands and his upper
body gracefully unfolded to a standing position. The professor gave Bobby three scoops of
ice cream and Bobby walked away smiling as he dipped his spoon into the soft, delicious
snack.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >       The other students quickly jumped out of their seats when they saw Bobby&#8217;s treat and they hurried
to form a rough shape looking similar to a line before the ice cream. Daniel energetically broke out
another four sets of push-ups and was only slightly panting as he stood in the front of the classroom still
grinning an energetic smile.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >       The students were happily relishing the delicacy not wasting any time to devour their ice cream.
The students in line shuffled impatiently and talked loudly among themselves about last weekend or the
latest gossip as they waited. None seemed to notice or consider Daniel. More students came and went and
he was now panting heavily. His massive chest was rising and falling like the sea as he tried to catch his
breath.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >       Another couple students came and went, 9... 10... Now Daniel did not jump up from the floor after
each set but rather was kneeling on one knee, with his right arm laying across his leg supporting his
hunched over body.
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >       Slowly the students began to realize the strenuous effort Daniel was putting forth and silence
slowly crept over the room as they watched Daniel. Some whispered among themselves but no one got out
of line.

<!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >       7... 8... 9... 10.
<!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >       It was taking Daniel much longer to complete the push-ups now. He strained and grunted as he
slowly lifted himself up. When his arms were fully extended, he came crashing back down, unable to
catch himself gracefully as before.
<!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >       Colton was next. He looked at Daniel and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any ice cream.&#8221;
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >       The professor looked saddened and he responded, &#8220;That is okay, but Daniel has to do the push-ups
anyways.&#8221;
<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >       Everyone but Daniel looked at the professor as if he had told them to jump off a cliff.
<!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Sorry, but that is part of the deal. Continue Daniel.&#8221;
<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >       Daniel began his next set of push-ups and as he finished, the professor offered Colton his bowl of
ice cream.
<!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;But I don&#8217;t <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-120">want </span>any ice cream!&#8221; Colton yelled and he took the bowl and strode angrily over to
the trash can.
<!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; Daniel groaned, but it was too late and the ice cream was wasted. Daniel looked
hurt as he stared at the gray trash can.
<!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >       More students hesitatingly came and went. Daniel no longer got up off the floor. He
laid on the hard, dirty-white laminate with his hands down by his sides and his right cheek
turned into the floor. Sweat glistened across his brow and it slid ever slow slowly into his
eyes.
<!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >       Beth came up to the table, and looked at the professor squarely in the eye.
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;You can&#8217;t force him to do push-ups!&#8221; she accused.
<!--l. 186--><p class="indent" >       The professor replied coolly, &#8220;I&#8217;m not forcing him. Daniel has willingly volunteered to do
so.&#8221;
<!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >       Beth received her ice cream from the professor and turned to face Daniel.
<!--l. 191--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Thanks, Dan.&#8221;
<!--l. 193--><p class="indent" >       Richard was second from next. He stepped out of the line mumbling, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand this&#8221; and he
quickly strode out of the classroom, with the door slamming behind him. As everyone was eyeing the door

wondering if they could do the same, the professor nodded at Daniel and he began a set for Richard,
wasted as the ice cream was going to no one.
<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Dan, stop!&#8221; someone shouted but he continued.
<!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >       He battled with gravity, and sweat was now pouring off his face, pooling onto the floor. His
shoulder blades erupted like mountains from his back as he could no longer keep a straight
figure.
<!--l. 205--><p class="indent" >       Kathy and Emily were the last ones. They had watched Daniel all class long and now tears escaped
their eyes, painting silver path ways as they tumbled down their cheeks. Emily walked up to
Daniel. In her hand was her purple nalgene. She carefully unscrewed the lid and set it next to
him.
<!--l. 210--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Here, take this Dan.&#8221;
<!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >       Daniel returned a small smile back, his eyes gleaming as if to say, &#8220;Thank you&#8221;. He sat up and
brought the water bottle up to his mouth with both hands. Water sloshed out of the lid and drained onto his
shirt as he struggled to steady the opening against his lips.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >       4... 5... 6...
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >       He gasped for breath as he laid on the floor.
<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >       7...
<!--l. 223--><p class="indent" >       Trying to regain strength where there was none.
<!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >       8...
<!--l. 227--><p class="indent" >       Struggling to push himself up.
<!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >       9...
<!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >       Arms wobbling as he inched himself up the final time.
<!--l. 233--><p class="indent" >       10...
<!--l. 235--><p class="indent" >       And he collapsed on the floor, motionless.
<!--l. 237--><p class="indent" >       A couple students came forward and pulled him up into an empty chair. His head was
rested to one side and his arms hung loosely by his sides. His shirt was soaked and clung to his
skin.

<!--l. 241--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;Thank you Daniel for providing ice cream for everyone. I hope you all paid attention and will be
ready for the next exam. Class is dismissed.&#8221;
<!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >       The students filed out of the classroom, some turning their faces away from Daniel to avoid
making eye contact and quickly shuffled by. But others paused as they walked by to put their hands on his
shoulders or to offer a quiet &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
<!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >       After all the students had left, the professor thanked Dan again for helping him and asked, &#8220;How
did you feel about doing all those push-ups?&#8221;
<!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >       &#8220;It nearly killed me, yet I kinda liked it cause I earned ice cream for the class. The hardest part was
when I had to do push-ups that were wasted.&#8221;
<!--l. 259--><p class="indent" >

<!--l. 261--><p class="indent" >       For me this story really hammered home what Jesus is all about. He is someone who
lovingly endures sacrifices for others. Just as Daniel endured each and every one of those
push-ups so his classmates could enjoy ice cream, Jesus did even more so by enduring death
on the cross to ensure you and I could have the chance to pass through the pearly gates of
heaven.
<!--l. 267--><p class="indent" >       But how does one respond to such a sacrifice? The tragic part to this story is to realize that
sometimes sacrifices are wasted. Just as Daniel had to do push-ups for those that didn&#8217;t want
ice cream, so too has Jesus laid down his life for those that will reject the ice cream he has
offered. On the other hand, there are others who have taken what has been given to them and
give of themselves in return. Just like Emily who offered her water bottle to Daniel. Loving
sacrifice.
