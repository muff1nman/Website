<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >       Have you ever been gotten into an argument with someone on whether a container of
something is half-full verus it being half-empty? Of course, both are technically correct, but the
question may poke at something a bit deeper &#8212; how do we percieve the world around
us?
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >       I was reminded of this classic question a couple weeks ago. It was another golden day in
Golden, Colorado with the warm sun basking the autumn leaves that were on the verge of falling
from their stems, heavy from the copious colors welling from within. With such good weather, I
took the opportunity to ride my bike to school. I tuned the gears, and as I peddled
off, I was immediately reminded of the sun as it massaged my back. Yet at the same
time, it was gently contrasted by the cool wind that slipped through my jacket and
brushed across my face. As I rode through the street hearing the gentle rustle of leaves, I
thought of what a wonderful way biking was to get some exercise. Not only that, but
I also was able to save on precious money that my gas-guzzling Chevy Tahoe would
otherwise burn up into a wisp of exhaust. As I was thinking, I nearly peddaled through an
intersection without checking and laughed at myself for being so absentminded. I peddaled on
smiling.

<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >       Soon, I came to school and arrived at the usual spot where I locked my bike in the shade.
However to my surprise, I saw that the bike rack was full with every looped slot faithfully holding
an owners ride. Figuring I must have left late, I quickly remounted and peddled away from the
building, still not sure what to do. Then, in the distance I glimpsed another bicyclist pass between
a brick wall and a building into a sort of alcove sheltered on three sides by the building and
hidden on the fourth with the brick wall and some trees. I turned in the general direction
but slowed as I waited to see what the bicyclist would do. Sure enough, he emerged
from the alcove but without his bicycle and my hopes rose that I might find a spot. I
entered into the secluded alcove to find a couple benches, one occupied by a meditating
smoker. Between the benches was a small, bike rack about large enough for five or so bikes
and luckily enough for me there was a single spot remaining. I dismounted and quickly
tethered my bike to the rack, careful not to scratch it against the black, paint-peeling
piping. Yet as I turned to leave, something caught my eye. Something was not right.
I turned back around, getting a better look at the other bikes. Most of them stood
straight and tall as their owners had carefully balanced them against the frame as I had
done with mine. But one bike attached to the very outside of the rack was slouched
against the rack. It seemed it would fall over had it not been for the chain locking it to
the metal tubing. It was an older road bike with intricate designs around where the
black tubing intersected and what seemed to be hand crafted shifters placed in the
center of the handle bars, but the cushions around the handle bars was cracking from
constant weather exposure. It had steel petals but they were the color of a dying fire, a sad
reddish-orange without the hint of joyful yellows. The chain and gears no longer had
their metallic shine but had the hue of an oily brown mixed with a touch of rust. The
chain hung limp, and it was no longer wound around the front gears. Its tires were both
flat and the front tire had nearly come loose of the rim which now sat naked on the
concrete. Leaves were caught up in the spokes and had been blown into a small pile
where the rim lay exposed on the ground. Lastly, the seat was missing, and in its stead

was a rusting hole in the frame of the bike. I stood there staring at what once was a
bicycle.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >       It was not common to see bicycles like this on campus. Parking services had usually done a
stellar job of finding and removing abandoned bikes throughout campus. In fact, even
my friend Matt had told me not a month or so before that he had his bike claimed by
the ever-watchful parking services because he had not ridden it for a week or so. They
had broken the lock and he had to go to their office and describe it to prove rightful
ownership.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >       But this bike was neglected by both its owner and parking services. The alcove was hidden
and perhaps not very popular due to its small bike rack. The bike had been abandoned and left to
rot by its owner. But this is what perplexed me the most about the situation. Why would someone
leave a bike like this, locked up like some animal left to die? Although it was in bad shape, it could
be fixed up with just a small bit of effort. In fact, the bicycle shop was not a quarter mile away and
I had found myself there many times previously buying their cheap replacement tubes. So the
question remained, why would the owner abandon their bike, and I thought of a possible
story.
<!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >       Joey&#8217;s father had received the bike as a Christmas present right before his father had gone
off to college. It was his father&#8217;s dream bike with an eight-speed shifter. He used it to bike the 4
mile route to his campus every day, but he stopped using it as much after he graduated and had to
purchase a car to make the longer commute to work. He taught Joey to ride a bike early on.
It was something his father thought was important. He said, &#8220;One day, you will be
able to ride a roadster like mine and can have the freedom to go anywhere, just like I
did.&#8221;
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >       The day Joey went off to college was soon on the horizon, and just like clockwork, his father
presented Joey his bike, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will cherish it just as I did.&#8221; Although Joey doubted
his words, he couldn&#8217;t say no and put the bike in the back of his car when he left for
college.

<!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >       At college Joey thought about everything but his father&#8217;s bicycle. In fact, it just stayed in
his apartment room and took up space. He would have completely forgotten about it had it not
been for his father&#8217;s subtle questionings when he talked to him every now and then. His father
would ask, &#8220;Bike still working well?&#8221; and Joey would lie and say that it was working great. Maybe
it was this small lie and bit of guilt that had begun to fester within Joey that provoked him to ride
it one day to class.
<!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >       Joey didn&#8217;t live particularly far away, maybe a mile or so, but it was far enough that he
didn&#8217;t like to walk and usually drove. He awkwardly got on the bike and started off. Or
tried to. The shifting derailleurs were terribly misaligned and had been so since the day
he shoved the bike in his car with all his stuff. As such, the first time he shifted, the
chain fell off the gears and wrapped around the right pedal. He got off the bike and
wrapped the chain back onto the gears, pinching his hand in the large sprocket and
dirtying them up from the grease in the process. Still determined to get to class, he
started off again, but as he began to speed up, he realized he couldn&#8217;t shift beyond
the 5th gear. It was frustrating but he continued on anyways pedaling quickly but not
covering much ground. Not knowing all the traffic laws pertaining to bicyclists, Joey
decided to keep to the sidewalks as it just seemed safer. About halfway to campus, he
came across an intersection. Seeing no cars on either side, he went to cross over to the
sidewalk on the other side. Just before he could enter the sidewalk, Joey heard the
low hum of an engine and sound of gravel grinding under rubber come up from behind
him. The car came into his peripheral vision and then it quickly turned right at the
intersection he was just about to enter. He squeezed the brakes and the cantilever brakes
squealed loudly. The car passed in front of him, missing him by a couple of feet and as
he came to a stop, he lost his balance and fell over, his backpack dragged him to the
earth. His right knee contacted the hard pavement first, followed by his two palms.
Joey stood up quickly hoping no one else saw and hoisted his bike off the ground. The
pain then came rushing as his pavement-seared hands tried to clench the handlebars.

Not wanting to assess the damage, he peddled on, ignoring the shoots of pain from his
knees.
<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >       When he finally arrived at campus, flustered, out of breath and hurt, he rode over to where
one of his friends, Mike, liked to take his smoke breaks at. There was a small bike rack there that
he had seen before when talking to Mike once. He threw the bike against the easiest spot to get to,
the outside of the bike rack, and locked it with the bike lock his father had given him. He turned
and left to class.
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >       In class, he quickly whispered to another friend, Zach, the story of his first bike ride, telling
him how miserable it was. Zach kindly offered him a ride back to his apartment and suggested that
Joey could get the bike another day. That never happened and he forgot about the bike.
He told his father it was stolen. He could tell by his father&#8217;s tone that he was a bit
heartbroken and his father proposed that he should report it missing to the police. He never
did.
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >       What if I told you that the two bike rides described previously were identical in their
sequence of events and only differ in the way they were told? With that in mind, it is interesting to
note how sometimes we only see the negative consequences of a story, rather than see the
good that was right there all along. Is it just easier to pick out the gloomy aspects of
life rather than the cheerful ones? When one pictures an old bike, does one envision a
peaceful ride though autumn decorated roads or a fight with a dangerous, malfunctioning
piece-of-junk? So with that, we each have a choice in how much value we find in the people and
things around us and it is left for us to decide: is it better to see the glass half-empty or
half-full?
