I just found one of the coolest things that I wish I would have found years ago!
You know when you get those songs from random places; friends, cds, shady places
on the internet, etc and for whatever reason you don\'t get the track information
with the song?  It bugs the crap out of me, mostly because I like my music
library nice and neat. 

Introducing the Last.fm fingerprint plugin for Banshee.  This gives me the
option to right click on any song in my library and have it match the sound
signature with one on Last.fm\'s service. Of the 20 or so songs I tried it out
with, it worked perfectly and was able to find the correct artist, ablum and
title in addition to the other good info.  Neato!
