We've all been there.  You've pulled up the streetlight and standing at the
corner is a scruffy looking man (I've hardly seen women), with dirty clothes and
his few belongings with a cardboard sign.  The signage varies wildly; "Need
food, war veteran", "3 kids and no money", or even "Need alcohol". Except for
the last one, the verbage is actually very similar; I am in need of your help,
please give me money. 

So when you are coming up to that stop light, you may be thinking, "Oh great,
another homeless person."  But here comes the catch.. We all think of some
excuse not to roll down the window.  I have caught myself doing this so many
times. Some of my reasons have been; I dont have any cash, I'm not rich and
don't have any to spare, the homeless person is just going to buy drugs/alcohol
with it, Im in a hurry, or even, they're on the right side of the car (the
passenger side) and it is too inconvienent. Im sure you have your reasons too. 

One of my common reasons was the thought that they should just go to a shelter.
My parents give to a few of those shelters anyways.  So why don't they just go
there?  Maybe they just want drugs and/or alcohol?  So I don't give them any
money.

Recently, I changed my mind about this.  And here is why.  When we chance upon
that homeless person on the side of the street we only have 2 seconds or so to
get an ever so short a glimpse into that persons life.  How is it possible for
us to judge whether that person needs money or not. How is it possible to judge
whether their intensions are good based on this short happenstance?

So rather than being the judge of who gets money or not, I have decided to give
out money to every single person who asks me for it. It may not be much, as I
ususally don't carry around a whole lot of cash, but when I see a homeless
person with that chicken scratch handwriting on a piece of cardboard, I dont
turn them down.  5, 10, 20 or even 2 if I am running low.  Just anything, and
here is why.  

There is so much more story behind the eyes of a homeless person that you or I just
cannot see.  They may have lost the capability to work due to a disability, they
may have no education, they may have had their house burn down, or maybe they
are just lazy.  The thing is that we cannot distinguish the difference.  My Dad
told me this story of a homeless guy once.  He would sit in the business
district of the Denver Tech center and ask for money. His sign was simple,
"Homeless, need help" and he looked the part of one.  Untrimmed beard, dirty
face, torn clothing. Perhaps due to the bustle of the area he had chosen to
stake out, many people would help him out throughout the day.  However, at the
end of the business day, that homeless person would transform.  He would walk
down to the grocery store where his car was parked, take off the fake beard, put
on a nice shirt and drive away. An imposter if you will, making a living from
disguising as a homeless person.

So we should just never give the street beggers money right?  I had a friend
once, who mentioned that instead of giving out money to homeless, she would
instead give out granola bars. She would buy one of those huge green boxes of Nature
Valley bars from Costco and whenever she saw someone on the side of the street,
she would hand them a couple of these bars. 

Great idea, right?  After all, the homeless just need food, and this will
prevent not only the imposters but also prevent them from buying anything like
drugs. Not to say that my good friend, or anyone who does a similar thing is
wrong, but this is not the way to think about it.  Instead we should trust in
God and the Holy Spirit acting in that individual to purchase the needed
essentials of life with that money we give out.  We as individuals are merely
acting as catalysts of Gods Grace, pieces of one large jigsaw puzzle and as such
we cannot see our neighbor and cannot see the grand scheme of how their life
fits into the world. Therefore, we should not limit the potential of the Holy
Spirit by providing only a granola bar, we should give out the more useable
resource.. cash.

Another way to think of it is to imagine that homeless person as Jesus.  Jesus
with a cardboard sign and the rough broken English of a foreigner asks you for
money.  Are you first going to ask him what he is going to do with it?  Of
course not.  You immediately assume his intentions are Holy and give him
whatever he asks of you. Now, this example might be a tad extreme because if we
went through a capitalistic society imagining everyone else as Jesus, we
wouldn't make it very far ourselves would we?  But here is where your good
judgement comes to play.  Instead of drinking that coffee that morning, or
buying that candy bar at the store, don't. Give it to someone else in the hope
that your sacrifices will be the joy of someone else.  

With that said, I get very angry at Catholics sometimes.  I sat in Mass one day.
The homily was about their lastest campaign... To raise money for renovating
their education center. He mentioned they had raised all the money they
needed for the first phase of the project, to replace the roofing and replace
the ventialiation systems, and that they were well on there way to funding phase 2 and 3
which were a couple years out yet.  The priest went on to say how the church had
raised an additional $900,000 for the arch bishops appeal and how they had done
an excellent job.  

Okay great.  The arch bishops appeal is a great cause that
helps out families in need. Nothing too different here.

Now after Mass was over, I was waiting in the line of cars to turn out of the
parking lot.  As I got closer I noticed a man and his wife. The former was
holding a cardboard sign and the latter was cradling a baby. My first thought
was that this family will get plenty attention from all the good meaning
Catholics leaving Mass.  But you know what?  Not a single one of them stopped.
Not even me. I am sure we all had our reasons.  Mine was that I had no cash at
the time. And shame on the hypocrit I am! Nevertheless, I would like to point out
that for Catholics, it is so easy for us to give gobs of money to a formal appeal from the
church with these nice convienient envelops and pencils they have waiting for us
in the pews.  But once outside of the Church, we *lose* our Catholicism, nay,
our Christianity. If your cause isn't presented to us in a nice wrapped up
envelope, and you don't take a credit card, forget it. You wont get even a cent.
You might as well have asked a bunch of college students to give you money, and
probably even had better luck with that group.

I would love to be wrong on this, I really would. I would love to believe that
every single one of those cars that passed that family had a much better reason
for doing so than I. I just wish the world I lived was more compasionate.  Don't
get me wrong, Im sure you few compasionate people are working diligently to make
the world a better place and not getting any recognition for your service. But I
also sure that many of us, myself included, could learn a couple lessons in
this department.
