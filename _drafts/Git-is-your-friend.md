Git, the Source Code Management(SCM) software, has always been a double edged
sword for me. On one hand, it is a handy tool that seems to magically track changes of
a code base across multiple developers allowing concurrent work. On the other
hand, there are those occurances where commits conflicted, merges were botched,
pulling messed up current work, commits and stashes
were lost, and the list goes on.  If StackOverflow is any indication, git might
appear to be this tempramental monster with which encounters should be avoided at
all costs. Perhaps it was the thought of being a cowardly knight that encouraged
me to work towards a better understanding of the beast. Although this
is still a journey in progress, I'd like to share some of my lessons learnt from
being burnt.

- structuring code locally
- structring code as a project
- merging/rebasing
- internals
- using git for software development / research

TODO
-----
- capitalize occurances of git
