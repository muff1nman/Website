I have always been annoyed by having to create passwords for new sites.
Most might argue the most infuriating aspect is remembering them all; however
there are numerous tools like LastPass or the built in remember-my-password
features for most browsers to help one through these moments. Heck you might even
take the old-school route and just store credentials in an encrypted TrueCrypt
file. So remembering them is not the most annoying thing about creating new
passwords, rather finding ones that are even acceptable by some arbitrary
website is the new challenge.

Each website seems to define its password standards differently.  For example,
some might declare that a password has to contain at least one number and one
letter.  Or another might further add the stipulation that the length must be
between 8 and 16 characters. I'm sure you've been there yourself many times trying to
create passwords to fit a new password standard.  There is some research done in
the regard as to whether these password policies really help:

[here](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~mmazurek/papers/chi2011_passwords_people.pdf).
Especially in the former one it is shown that strict stipulations may not be all
that beneficial to forcing strong passwords. But regardless of effect of these
password criterion, I would like to share my own frustrating experience creating
a password for the MyPanera card from Panera Bread.
