    <h3>Hi, website reader!</h3>
    <p>
    My name is Andrew DeMaria.  I study Computer Science at <a
        href="shoot!">Colorado School of Mines</a> and so far absolutely
    love it!  Some of my favorite topics are:  
    <ol>
        <li>Algorithms</li>
        <li>Information Security and Privacy</li>
        <li>Computer Graphics</li>
        <li>UI Design</li>
        <li>Cryptography</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    Whenever I am not coding, I enjoy shooting pictures of the awe-inspiring
    Colorado Wilderness.  My preferred travel methods are skiing, backpacking,
    hiking, and climbing.
